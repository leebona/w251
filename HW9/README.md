# Homework 9
## Questions
### 1. How long does it take to complete the training run? (hint: this session is on distributed training, so it will take a while)
### 2. Do you think your model is fully trained? How can you tell?
### 3. Were you overfitting?
### 4. Were your GPUs fully utilized?
### 5. Did you monitor network traffic (hint: apt install nmon)? Was network the bottleneck?
### 6. Take a look at the plot of the learning rate and then check the config file. Can you explain this setting?
### 7. How big was your training set (mb)? How many training lines did it contain?
### 8. What are the files that a TF checkpoint is comprised of?
### 9. How big is your resulting model checkpoint (mb)?
### 10. Remember the definition of a "step". How long did an average step take?
  - Average time per step was 1.625s.
### 11. How does that correlate with the observed network utilization between nodes?
